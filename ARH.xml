**What it does**

ARH method computes the splicing deviation between conditions for every exon and transforms it into a probability for differential splicing. A gene-wise entropy computed from the probabilities helps to quantify differential splicing.


**Output** 

            1. List of spliced genes ordered by ARH.
            2. Plot containing curves, which represent the exons expressions of a gene through different experimental conditions, and also, the probability of each exon to be alternatively spliced.
